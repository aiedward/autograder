##SETUP

For our project we are using Python 2.7, NLTK and Pyenchant. We are also using the Stanford Parser which requires JRE 1.8. 

__Please update src/stanfordParser.py__ with the correct java 1.8 path. If the correct java is already in your PATH, then comment these lines out.

__Additionally, please add stanford-parser-3.5.2-models.jar to lib/__

The input requires tokenized text.

Run make to install the necessary packages and to test the data. 
NOTE: The NLTK POS tagger requires a couple of corpora to be installed as well. You will get an error if they are not.

##TECHNIQUE
		
For spelling, we counted the number of words that did not appear in the pyenchant dictionary divided by the wordcount.

For subject-verb agreement, we made a list of violating rules and counted the occurrences of such rules in the essay divided by the number of tags.

For verb tense agreement, we used a similar process for subject-verb agreement.

For length, we noticed a strong correlation between the number of unique verbs and the overall essay score so added that as a factor for the essay length along with the number of unique POS tags and the number of sentences.

###Score Calculation
		We have learned the cutoff points for each category based on our training data. The model is loaded automatically into the program by calling test.
